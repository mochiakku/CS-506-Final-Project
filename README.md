# CS 506 Final Project: Predicting Housing Prices Using Real Estate Data
- Description: The project aims to predict housing prices based on the size of the house, location, number of rooms, proximity to amenities, and neighborhood characteristics. 
- Goal: Successfully predict the price of a house based on the characteristics mentioned above.
- How to collect data: We plan to collect data from open real estate datasets such as Zillow’s housing dataset or the MLS (Multiple listing services). 
  We will collect: 
  - House price
  - Square Footage
  - Number of bedrooms
  - Year built
  - Neighborhood rating
  - Proximity to services
  To collect this data we will scrape the Zillow Website and/or use an API.
- Modelling: We plan on modeling the data by fitting a linear model (linear regression) to predict housing prices based on features such as location, size, and number of rooms.
- Visualization: We plan to visualize the data using a scatter plot to show the relationship between square footage and price, and a heatmap to illustrate correlations between features. 
- Test Plan: We plan to use an 80/20 train-test split, where 80% of the data will be used to train the model, and the remaining 20% will be used to test the model's performance. Additionally, we may use cross-validation to further assess the model’s accuracy across different subsets of the data.
