# CS 506 Final Project: Predicting Housing Prices Using Real Estate Data
- Description: The project aims to predict housing prices based on the size of the house, location, number of rooms, proximity to amenities, and neighborhood characteristics. 
- Goal: Successfully predict the price of a house based on the characteristics mentioned above.
- How to collect data: We plan to collect data from open real estate datasets such as Zillowâ€™s housing dataset or the MLS (Multiple listing services). 
  We will collect: 
  - House price
  - Square Footage
  - Number of bedrooms
  - Year built
  - Neighborhood rating
  - Proximity to services
  To collect this data we will scrape the Zillow Website and/or use an API.
